<h3>Delicious and Juicy</h3>

<h4>This gourmet breakfast dish is a delicacy in eastern Burbank. Although the ingredients 
    are hard to find (due to the impact of climate change on local cereal plants), if you
    find yourself a reliable and affordable cereal dealer this recipe is a MUST TRY. 
    You know what they say.. "When in Burbank, do as the Burbankians do."
